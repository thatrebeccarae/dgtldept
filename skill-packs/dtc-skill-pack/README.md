## How the Skills Connect

```
Shopify (orders, products, customers)
    |
    +--> Klaviyo (flows, segments, campaigns, email/SMS)
    |        |
    |        +--> GA4 (traffic, behavior, conversions)
    |        |
    |        +--> Looker Studio (cross-platform dashboards)
    |
    +--> Pro Deck Builder (polished presentations from any analysis)
```

The skills work independently, but they complement each other:
- Run a **Shopify** audit to find conversion issues, then check **Klaviyo** flows that address them
- Use **Looker Studio** scripts to push Klaviyo + Shopify data to Google Sheets for unified dashboards
- Analyze **GA4** traffic sources, then cross-reference with **Klaviyo** campaign performance
- Turn any analysis into a polished deck with **Pro Deck Builder**

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Interactive Wizard (Recommended)

```bash
python scripts/setup.py
```

The wizard checks prerequisites, walks you through API key setup, installs dependencies, and tests connections.

### Option 2: Manual Setup

See [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions.

### Option 3: Copy Skills Directly

If you already have API keys configured:

```bash
for skill in klaviyo-analyst klaviyo-developer google-analytics shopify looker-studio pro-deck-builder; do
  cp -r "$skill" ~/.claude/skills/
done
```

## Prerequisites

### Klaviyo MCP Server (for Analyst + Developer skills)

The [Klaviyo MCP server](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/docs/klaviyo_mcp_server) gives Claude direct access to your Klaviyo account data.

**1. Create a Klaviyo Private API Key**

1. Log in to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/login) (requires Owner, Admin, or Manager role)
2. Click your **organization name** in the bottom-left corner
3. Go to **Settings** > **API keys**
4. Click **Create Private API Key**
5. Name the key (e.g., `claude-code-mcp`), select **Read-only** scopes
6. Click **Create** and **copy the key immediately**

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
export KLAVIYO_API_KEY="pk_your_key_here"
```

**Recommended scopes:**

| Scope | Minimum (Read-only) | Full Access |
|-------|---------------------|-------------|
| Accounts | Read | Read |
| Campaigns | Read | Full |
| Catalogs | Read | Read |
| Events | Read | Full |
| Flows | Read | Read |
| Lists | Read | Read |
| Metrics | Read | Read |
| Profiles | Read | Full |
| Segments | Read | Full |
| Tags | Read | Read |
| Templates | Read | Full |

**2. Install the MCP Server**

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Add to `~/.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "klaviyo": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["klaviyo-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "PRIVATE_API_KEY": "${KLAVIYO_API_KEY}",
        "READ_ONLY": "true",
        "ALLOW_USER_GENERATED_CONTENT": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Code and verify with `/mcp`.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need all six skills?

No. Install only the skills for platforms you use. Each skill works independently. The Klaviyo Analyst skill is the recommended starting point.

### Do I need the Klaviyo MCP server?

The MCP server lets Claude pull live data from your Klaviyo account (flows, segments, campaigns, metrics). Without it, Claude still has full Klaviyo expertise but you'll need to provide data manually (paste metrics, share screenshots, or use the included scripts).

### What Klaviyo API scopes are needed?

Read-only scopes are sufficient for all audit and analysis tasks. Only enable write scopes if you want Claude to help build integrations that modify data.

### Can I use this with multiple Klaviyo accounts?

Yes. Configure multiple MCP server entries in `~/.mcp.json` with different environment variable names (e.g., `KLAVIYO_API_KEY_BRAND1`, `KLAVIYO_API_KEY_BRAND2`).

### How is this different from Klaviyo's built-in AI?

Klaviyo's AI features work within the Klaviyo UI for specific tasks (subject line generation, segment suggestions). This skill pack gives Claude deep, cross-platform expertise: it can audit your entire DTC marketing stack, compare Klaviyo data with Shopify and GA4, produce implementation specs, and generate presentation decks -- all from natural language prompts in your terminal.
